# S01E01-Halftones

# Step 1: Setup
Since this is the first episode and the first time we're setting up a lit application,
lets focus on the first steps of laying out our application.

In this first step, we cover:

- Creating our gitignore and putting our assets into place
- Creating a package.json and installing our dependencies
- Creating our application source folder with a single component folder
- Creating our index.html and pointing to our app component source
- Creating our first component file (app.js) with an index.js entry point
- Fill in our component with Lit functionality and render some HTML
- Import Spectrum Web Components and add a theme container
- Build out our layout using HTML and CSS
- Get the halftone component working
- Add a background slot
